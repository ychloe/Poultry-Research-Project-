# Effect of Air Movement on Chicks’ Body Temperature Analysis                                                           
#1.	Cleaned the dataset including eliminating the unrelated variables and combining the repeated measurements.  
#2.  Built and Tested the model for chicks’ rectal temperature vs. frank temperature and improved the experiment error by showing the chicks’ rectal temperature measurements can be replaced by frank’s temperature measurements.  
#3.	Constructed and Tested a mixed model with a random effect on chicks’ body temperature under different brooding conditions.  
#4. 	Built an R visualization solution for chicken’s best-brooding conditions to improve poultry production.
